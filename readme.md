# CPP Games
## Intro
This project was written in c++, it is INCOMPLETE, do not expect it to look nice or be polished.  This is mainly a project for me to learn more C++.

There is no license, but be warned there will be bugs and/or unfinished features.

Due to no license, use the code as you please, no need to give credit.


## Compile
To compile you need g++

Run this command in the directory the files are in.

`g++ ./cli.cpp ./games/rps.cpp -o cppgames`

This will give you a `cppgames.exe` in the directory, then you will be able to run it via the command line.  As long as you're specifying the path to the executable.

Example: (You don't need to specify an exact path if you're in the directory it is.)

`cppgames`

To exit the program safely, use the command "--exit" at any time it asks for input, including while playing a game!  Try not to close the terminal you are using, use the command.

Now you can enjoy!
